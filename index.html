    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="about">After earning my bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, I accepted a position at Honeywell Intelligrated as a Strategic Sourcing Engineer. I am grateful to have had the chance to impact real world projects at the edge of warehouse automation, but I decided I wanted to persue a career where I would be the one building and automating things. So, I thought I'd learn to code.</p>
