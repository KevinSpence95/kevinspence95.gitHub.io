    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="about">After earning my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, I accepted a position at Honeywell Intelligrated as a Strategic Sourcing Engineer. I am grateful to have had the chance to impact real world projects at the edge of warehouse automation, but I decided to pursue a career more in line with my creative and technical nature. I love to design and build things, I work great in teams, and I love learning about technology.        </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>When COVID hit and the markets crashed, It felt like the perfect time for me to raise my financial IQ and take advantage of the fear in the markets. I spent many hours learning about the stock market, doing market research, studying movements of professional fund managers, and identifying some of the most techonologically disruptive companies around today (many of them software companies). Additionally, I taught myself how to implement a variety of options trading strategies. I also found myself absolutely fascinated by blockchain tech, and would spend hours and hours learning about exciting new projects and unique use cases. </p></li>
      <li><p>My forray into investing/trading gave me an interesting perspective into the technologies that will shape our world tomorrow and made me realize that the software field is where I need to be. </p></li>

      <p>Programming has been a part of my life for a long time, starting with the Java course I took in highschool.  As an engineering undergrad, I encountered several other languages. I programmed PLCs with C++ in robotics competitions, controlled CNC machines and robotic arms with G-code in machine shops, and conducted data analysis/visualization with MATLAB in engineering labs. As a strategic sourcing engineer, I spent a lot of time using excel (if you can call that a programming language).  More recently, I have been focused on teaching myself Front-End Web Developement technologies, but I've also been learning to use Python and the Numpy/Pandas libraries.</p>
