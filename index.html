        <p id="about">
          After earning my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, I accepted a position
          at Honeywell Intelligrated as a Strategic Sourcing Engineer. I am
          grateful to have had the chance to impact real world projects at the
          edge of warehouse automation, but I've decided to pursue a career more
          in line with my creative and technical nature. I love to build things,
          I work great in teams, and I love learning about technology.

                  In early 2020, I decided to enter the world of investing /
                  trading for the first time. I felt I had a good vantage point
                  of the day’s technological landscape and felt confident that
                  the pandemic would only serve as a catalyst for innovation and
                  the continued growth of big tech, so that’s where I directed
                  my attention. I spent my days learning as much as I could
                  about the markets, different asset classes and financial
                  instruments. I studied the movements of professional fund
                  managers, identified disruptive companies, and developed a
                  timely fascination with blockchain technology. My good fortune
                  afforded me the time pursue music and ultimately discover my
                  dream career, WEB DEVELOPEMENT!!!

                  My 15 month foray into investing/trading left me with a
                  renewed perspective of the tech shaping our world, and a
                  profound respect for the computers and software underpinning
                  it all. By July 2021, I resolved to stop trading, and begin
                  preparing myself for a web developement career using a variety
                  of online resources. (Free Code Camp, The Odin Project,

          I was first introduced to programming my senior year of highschool
          with Java. It peaked my interest, but not enough to persue a computer
          science degree at the time. However, my programming journey continued
          as a mechanical engineering undergrad, where I co-programmed PLCs
          using C++ in robotics competitions, controlled CNC milling machines
          with G-code in machine shops, and conducted data
          analysis/visualizations with MATLAB in labs. Once I decided to
          investigate the possibility of programming as a career, I spent a few
          months learning Python and a few popular data science libraries before
          shifting my focus towards JavaScript and relevant front-end
          technologies, which I immediately found captivating. Ever since, I've
          been working towards becoming a web developer.

            Please note that the projects showcased only capture a snapshot of
            my journey in web development and do not encompass the full breadth
            of my skills. To streamline my learning process, I’ve meticulously
            compiled a comprehensive database using Notion. This “second brain”
            of mine is a well-organized repository of notes, examples, and
            resources I’ve accumulated over time. It covers a wide array of
            topics including data structures, algorithms, design patterns, best
            practices, rendering patterns, SEO, CSS tricks, TypeScript, Node.js,
            Express, and MongoDB to list a few. This systematic approach to
            learning has been instrumental in my growth as a developer.

        <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently seeking a front-end developement position. However, I'm
          aware of the current state of the tech jobs market, so I'd also
          consider any position relevent to my mechanical engineering / finance
          / sourcing / estimating skill set. I'm willing and able to learn just
          about anything. I have the ability to commute in the Columbus, OH area
          and or can work remotely. Whether you're part of an established
          business, a startup, or just passing through, I'd love to hear from
          you.
        </p>
