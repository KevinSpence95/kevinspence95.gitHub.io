        <!-- <p id="about">
          After earning my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, I accepted a position
          at Honeywell Intelligrated as a Strategic Sourcing Engineer where I
          had the chance to impact real world projects at the edge of warehouse
          automation. More recently, I've been pursuing a career more in line
          with my creative and technical nature. I’m a multifaceted, naturally
          curious person that is addicted to learning new things. I approach
          everything I do as an Engineer with continuous improvement in mind,
          and thrive in environments that demand creative problem solving and
          careful analysis.
        </p> -->
        <p id="about">
          Welcome to my webpage! I am currently seeking new employment
          opportunities! With a backgorund in mechanical engineering, and over 3
          years of experience in procurement, I've had an impact on real world
          projects at the edge of both warehouse automation and data center
          thermal management. I’m a naturally curious person and
          am extremely methodical and meticulus. I try to approach everything
          from an engineering perpective and thrive in environments that demand
          creative problem solving and thoughtful analysis.

                  In early 2020, I decided to enter the world of investing /
                  trading for the first time. I felt I had a good vantage point
                  of the day’s technological landscape and felt confident that
                  the pandemic would only serve as a catalyst for innovation and
                  the continued growth of big tech, so that’s where I directed
                  my attention. I spent my days learning as much as I could
                  about the markets, different asset classes and financial
                  instruments. I studied the movements of professional fund
                  managers, identified disruptive companies, and developed a
                  timely fascination with blockchain technology. My good fortune
                  afforded me the time pursue music and ultimately discover
                  another passion of mine, WEB DEVELOPEMENT!!!

                  profound respect for the computers and software underpinning
                  it all. By July 2021, I resolved to stop trading, and begin
                  preparing myself for a web development career using a variety

                  Engaged with project engineers, commodity managers, and
                  suppliers early in the development process, to help inform the
                  design of the units so that manufacturing and cost targets
                  would be met.

                  Played a key role in the production transfer of the XDU100
                  from Vertiv China to Monterrey Mexico as well as the design
                  transfer of the XDU1350 from Vertiv Slovakia for production in
                  Monterrey. In both cases, I worked to localize the supply
                  chains for these CDUs to North America.

          I was first introduced to programming my senior year of high school
          with Java. It peaked my interest, but not enough to pursue a computer
          science degree at the time. However, my programming journey continued
          as a mechanical engineering undergrad, where I co-programmed PLCs
          using C++ in robotics competitions, controlled CNC milling machines
          with G-code in machine shops, and conducted data
          analysis/visualizations with MATLAB in labs. Once I decided to
          investigate the possibility of programming as a career, I spent a few
          months learning Python and a few popular data science libraries before
          shifting my focus towards JavaScript and relevant front-end
          technologies, which I immediately found captivating. Ever since, I've
          been working towards honing my skills a web developer.

            practices, rendering patterns, SEO, CSS tricks, TypeScript, Node.js,
            and Express to list a few. This systematic approach to learning has
