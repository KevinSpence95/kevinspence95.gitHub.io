    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="about">After earning my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, I accepted a position at Honeywell Intelligrated as a Strategic Sourcing Engineer. I am grateful to have had the chance to impact real world projects at the edge of warehouse automation, but I've decided to pursue a career more in line with my creative and technical nature. I love to design and build things, I work great in teams, and I love learning about technology.        </p>

      <li><p>I left Honeywell Intelligrated and moved back to Columbus just before the pandemic for personal reasons. In March 2020, I decided to enter the world of investing/trading for the first time and became hooked. As a chronically curious mechanical engineer, I felt I had a good vantage point of the day’s technological landscape and felt confident that pandemic would only serve as a catalyst for technological innovation… so that’s where I directed my attention. I spent my days learning as much as I could about the markets, different asset classes and financial instruments. I studied the movements of professional fund managers and identified disruptive companies to invest in/trade options on. I developed a timely fascination with cryptocurrencies and would scour the internet for unique projects and use cases for blockchain technology.</p></li>
      <li><p>My 15 month foray into investing/trading left me with a renewed perspective of the tech shaping our world, and a profound respect for the computers and software underpinning it all. By July 2021, I resolved to stop trading, and begin preparing myself for a career as a front-end software developer using a variety of online resources.</p></li>

      <p>Programming has been a part of my life for a long time, starting with Java in highschool.  As an mechanical engineering undergrad, I encountered several languages. I co-programmed PLCs with C++ in robotics competitions, controlled CNC milling machines with G-code in machine shops, and conducted data analysis/visualization with MATLAB in engineering labs.  After deciding I wanted to become a software developer, I spent a few months teaching myself Python and a few popular data science libraries before settling on web developement, specifically JavaScript and React.</p>
